InstantBets Frontend

Synopsis:
This is an Angular2 project, that uses TypeScript.
It uses a wide variety of plugins, the plugin list (updated as of June 20, 2017):

	Auth0 (Handles Login and Authentication)
	Font Awesome [http://fontawesome.io/icons/] (Has a lot of useful, easy and free to use icons.)
	JQuery (Has a lot of helpful animations, key watchers and DOM manipulators)
	RxJS (Gives better than native Angular Observables [good for not overflowing API])

Installation (This alone gives you access to the frontend, but won't save anything if not connected to API):

	git clone
	npm install
	npm start
	(leave open)
